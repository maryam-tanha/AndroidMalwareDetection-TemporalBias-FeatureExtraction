# Static Android Malware Analysis

This repository is dedicated to Static Android Malware Analysis, providing tools and code for various stages of the analysis process. Static analysis is a crucial step in understanding the behavior of Android malware without executing the code. The repository is organized into different directories, each serving a specific purpose in the analysis pipeline.

## Directory Structure:

### 1. DataCollection
- Contains code related to data collection for Android malware analysis.
- Particularly, we provide code and instructions on how we downloaded the malware and benign android APKs.
- Note: We got all our malware APKs from VirusShare and benign APKs from Androzoo.

### 2. FeatureExtraction
- Code and resources for extracting features from Android malware samples.
- We provide 3 alternatives to doing feature extraction - Local IDE, Google Collab, and Java Mobile App

### 3. MachineLearningModels
- Hosts machine learning models for Android malware detection.
- We provide all the code for doing feature selection and ML experiments (LNNs) with result files.

### 4. README.md
- This file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the repository and its contents.
