# Feature Files for Android Malware Detection
This repository contains the replication package and dataset of the paper published _________________________

For more information, interested researchers can contact us by sending an email to ________________. The full dataset is available below.

## Reproduced datasets
In this work, we replicate the features selected to create the dataset of the following high-profile ML-based Android malware detection approaches. 
* BL-based Android malware detection (BL-AMD): [pdf](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8944288)
* MobiTive: [pdf](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9204665)
* SIGPID: [pdf](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8255798)

## Dataset Creation
We wrote Python Scripts that took the features files of APKs as input and generated a csv file based on the features selected for the dataset.

The [Resources](https://github.com/maryam-tanha/StaticAndroidMalwareAnalysis/tree/main/DataCollection/BuildingFeatureFiles/resources) folder contains the list of feature names from the above papers which are used to create the headers of our csv file.

The [Output](https://github.com/maryam-tanha/StaticAndroidMalwareAnalysis/tree/main/DataCollection/BuildingFeatureFiles/output) folder contains the final result of running the python scripts which are the CSV files.
