Our data is not in any sequence and hence the sequence_length values in X_train is empty.

The X_train should be in the format torch.Size([batch_size, sequence_length, input_size]) but instead our X-train is in the format
torch.Size([batch_size, input_size])

I have put 1 as the sequence length as we do not ahve any particular sequence in our dataset.
