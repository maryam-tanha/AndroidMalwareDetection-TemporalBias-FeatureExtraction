#ML models created for dynamic analysis

Here I will summarize the code I added in this folder.

1) Creating the apk_dataset.csv file
2) The dataset was created using the gen_dummy_dataset.py code where I generate dummy data.
3) After the dataset was created, I started doing some data visualizations which could help in the actual dynamic analysis.
4) Since, my dataset was dummy, I didn't get anything useful from those visualizations.
5) Next step was to start creating ML models, I created the models inside models.py file
6) First thing was to read the dataset and manipulate it to use it in training and testing.
7) Removed the non-numeric and target columns from the dataset.
8) After that, sorted the dataset based on the timestamp, then divided the data into training and testing ensuring that the old data is assigned to training set.
9) After train-test split, I created models using the random forest and xgboost algorithms
10) to be continued.....
