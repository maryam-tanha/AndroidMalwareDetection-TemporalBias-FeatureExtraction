# Building Training and Test Sets:

## How to Use:

To create a dataset (with train and test sets) for a specefic upload year:

Run create\_dataset.py with 10,000 samples and 0.9 ratio for benign and 0.1 for malware. For example, for a dataset for apps with upload year of 2021, you should include the benign and malware feature vectors in the resources folder. The created dataset will be stored in the resources folder as well.


To create a training and tests sets for apps belonging to a time period, e.g., 2021 - 2022:

1. Run create\_test\_dataset.py. For a time period of 2021-2022, choose the input feature vectors from 2022.

2. Run create\_train\_dataset.py  For a time period of 2021-2022, choose the input feature vectors from 2021 and 2022.

*** NOTE *** Step 1 removes the app info from the feature vectors to ensure that they are not used in step 2 (i.e., training set).
