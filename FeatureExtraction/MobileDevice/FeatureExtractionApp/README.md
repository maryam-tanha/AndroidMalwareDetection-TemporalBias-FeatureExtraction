# Static Android Malware Analysis

## 1. Introductory Summary

This repository contains code for a Static Android Malware Analysis tool. The tool focuses on feature extraction from mobile devices to identify potential malicious applications. It provides a set of features that can be used to analyze and detect malware in Android apps. By leveraging static analysis techniques, this tool aims to enhance the detection and understanding of Android malware.

## 2. Execution Steps

To execute the Static Android Malware Analysis tool, follow these steps:

1. Install Android Studio(Dolphin release or a higher version) or another suitable Android development environment.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
3. Open the FeatureExtractionApp project in Android Studio.
4. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
5. Connect an Android device or use an emulator to run the application.
6. Launch the FeatureExtractionApp on the device/emulator.

# App Execution Summary:

- The slack.apk and whatsapp.apk files are installed onto the emulator for testing purposes.
- All the function calls are written in the onCreate() Method.
- The app asks for permissions to read and write to external directory.
- The Package Manager is used to detect the installed APK files on the emulator.
- The APK file path is retrieved using the package name, and the androidManifest.xml file is copied into the cache directory after unzipping the APK file.
- The Binary androidManifest.xml file is read from the cache and processed with <b>AXML Library</b>.
- Some helper functions are used to extract the permissions, intent-filters and hardware-software requirements from the Manifest File.
- The <b>DexLib2 Library</b> is used to decode the Dex files, and extract API Calls.
- The text output files are created in external directory. Example Given Below(Look in the files folder):
  - appname-hw-sw.txt
  - appname-intent-actions.txt
  - appname-permissions.txt
  - appname-api-calls.txt
- The app takes 5-6 seconds to extract features out of an APK file.

## 3. Output

When you run the FeatureExtractionApp, it performs static analysis on the installed applications on the Android device.
The output of the application includes the extracted features from each app, which can be utilized for further analysis or detection of potential malware.
The specific format or representation of the output may vary based on the implementation and requirements.

More specifically, the app produces the following files for a particular APK:

- appname
  - appname-hw-sw.txt
  - appname-intent-actions.txt
  - appname-permissions.txt
  - appname-api-calls.txt
  - appname-metrics.txt
