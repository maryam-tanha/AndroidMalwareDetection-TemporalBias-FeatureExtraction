# Extracted Feature Server

This Python script serves as a server for transferring feature folders, receiving their contents, and extracting files from them.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- `socket`, `select`, `os`, `time`, `zipfile`, `io` libraries

## Usage

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the server script (`server.py`).
3. Connect client devices or applications to the server IP and port to transfer extracted features.
4. The server receives extracted feature folders as zips, extracts their contents, and saves the features in the 'Features' directory. If
the Feature directory does not exist, it creates it.

## Server Operation

- Listens for incoming connections from a client.
- Receives zipped feature folders sent by a client.
- Extracts the contents of the zipped feature folders and saves them in separate directories under 'Features'.
- Signals clients during different stages of the transfer and extraction process.

## Configuration

Change the Server IP and Port on lines **54** and **55** of main.

## Files and Directories

- `server.py`: The main server script for handling APK transfer and extraction.
- `Features/`: Directory to store extracted features.

## Notes

- Ensure proper network connectivity between the server and clients.
- Received feature folders are extracted into a folder name received by the client under `Features/`. Example: `Features/ExampleStaticanalysis`.
- When a client connects, transfers a folder, and disconnects it gets logged to the terminal.
- If a feature folder already exists, it gets overwritten.
