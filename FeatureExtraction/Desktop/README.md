# Feature Extraction on Desktop

This directory contains a Python script, `feature-extraction.py`, designed for extracting various features from Android APK files. The script utilizes the Androguard library to analyze APK files and gather information related to permissions, metadata, hardware features, API calls, and intent actions.  
We have used [Androguard library](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) for feature extraction. Currently, the latest version is v4.1.1.
Androgaurd docs can be found [here](https://androguard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Files:

### 1. apks
- Input directory containing Android APK files for analysis.
### 2. android_features
- Output directory containing one folder for each app. Each app folder includes the extracted feature files for that app.
### 3. feature-extraction.py
- Python script for extracting various features from Android APK files using the Androguard library. The script performs metadata extraction, permission analysis, hardware components feature extraction, API call identification, and intent action retrieval.

## How to Use:

1. Place the target APK files in the `apks` directory or some directory on the hard drive that you define in the code.
2. Execute the `feature-extraction.py` script using Python.

```bash
python feature-extraction.py
```

3. Extracted features will be saved in separate text files within the `android_features` directory (or any other path that you define in the code).

## Notes:
- The script supports concurrency, processing multiple APK files concurrently for efficiency.
- In case of errors during processing, the script logs the errors in the `errorAPKS.txt` file.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or enhance the functionality of the feature extraction script. Happy analyzing!
