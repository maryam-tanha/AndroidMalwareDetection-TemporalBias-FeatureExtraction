# Feature Extraction on Desktop

This directory contains a Python script, `feature-extraction.py`, designed for extracting various features from Android APK files. The script utilizes the Androguard library to analyze APK files and gather information related to permissions, metadata, hardware and software features, API calls, and intent actions.  
We have used [Androguard library](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) for feature extraction.
Androgaurd docs can be found [here](https://androguard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Files:

### 1. apks
- Directory containing Android APK files for analysis.

### 2. Integrating the metric extraction
- Code related to integrating metric extraction into the feature extraction process. (Updated 6 months ago)

### 3. .gitignore
- Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

### 4. README.md
- Documentation providing an overview of the feature extraction script and the contents of this directory. (Restructured and removed unused code, Last updated 1 minute ago)

### 5. feature-extraction.py
- Python script for extracting various features from Android APK files using the Androguard library. The script performs metadata extraction, permission analysis, hardware and software feature extraction, API call identification, and intent action retrieval.

## How to Use:

1. Place the target APK files in the `apks` directory.
2. Execute the `feature-extraction.py` script using Python.

```bash
python feature-extraction.py
```

3. Extracted features will be saved in separate text files within the `E:\last-features` directory.

## Notes:
- The script supports concurrency, processing multiple APK files concurrently for efficiency.
- In case of errors during processing, the script logs the errors in the `errorAPKS.txt` file.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or enhance the functionality of the feature extraction script. Happy analyzing!
