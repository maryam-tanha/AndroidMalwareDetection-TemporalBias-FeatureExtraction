# VirusShare Malware Downloader and APK Downloader

This folder contains two Python scripts that allow you to download malware samples from VirusShare.com using its API.
## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- `dotenv` library (`pip install python-dotenv`) - Only required for the VirusShare Malware Downloader.
- `argparse` library (`pip install argparse`) - Only required for the APK Downloader.
- `coloredlogs` library (optional, for colored logs) - Only required for the APK Downloader.

## VirusShare Malware Downloader

This script allows you to download malware samples from VirusShare.com using their API. Before running the script, you need to set up an API key from VirusShare.com and save it in a `.env` file. The script will use this key to authenticate API requests.

### Configuration

1. Create a VirusShare API key by signing up on VirusShare.com.
2. Place your API key in a file named `.env` in the same directory as this script using the following format:
   ```
   VIRUSSHARE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### How to Use

1. Ensure that you have set up your API key in the `.env` file as described in the Configuration section.
2. Modify the script to provide the SHA256 hash of the malware sample you want to download. Replace `'some_malware_hash'` in the `download_malware` function call with the appropriate SHA256 hash.
3. Run the script. It will use the VirusShare API to download the malware sample associated with the provided hash.
4. The downloaded malware sample will be saved as a ZIP file with the same name as the hash.

**IMPORTANT:** Running the `download_malware` function will actually download real malware samples to your hard disk. Make sure to execute this function only in a controlled and isolated environment. Never run this script on your primary system or any sensitive machine.

## Multiple Malware APK Downloader from VirusShare

This Python script allows you to download APK files from VirusShare using a list of SHA256 hashes. It retrieves the corresponding APK files and saves them to a specified output directory.

### Usage

1. Clone or download the script from [here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/cidre-public/dada/-/blob/master).

2. Install the required libraries using pip (if not already installed):
   ```
   pip install requests argparse coloredlogs
   ```

3. Set up the VirusShare API key:
   - Sign up on VirusShare.com and obtain your API key.
   - Save your API key in a text file (e.g., `api_key.txt`) in the same directory as the script.

4. Prepare your hash list:
   - Create a text file containing the SHA256 hashes of the APKs you want to download (e.g., `hash_list.txt`).
   - Each line in the file should contain a single SHA256 hash.

5. Run the script with the following command:
   ```
   python apk_downloader.py api_key.txt hash_list.txt output_directory
   ```
   - `api_key.txt`: Path to the file containing your VirusShare API key.
   - `hash_list.txt`: Path to the file containing the SHA256 hashes.
   - `output_directory`: The directory where the downloaded APK files will be saved.

6. Sit back and relax. The script will download the APK files and save them to the specified output directory. It will also check for existing files with matching SHA256 hashes to avoid redundant downloads.

### Logging

The script provides three levels of logging: normal, verbose, and very verbose. You can set the logging level using command-line arguments as follows:

- For normal logging (default):
  ```
  python apk_downloader.py api_key.txt hash_list.txt output_directory
  ```

- For verbose logging (additional details):
  ```
  python apk_downloader.py -v api_key.txt hash_list.txt output_directory
  ```

- For very verbose logging (even more details):
  ```
  python apk_downloader.py -vv api_key.txt hash_list.txt output_directory
  ```

**Note**: Verbose and very verbose logging levels require the `coloredlogs` library to display colored logs. If you don't have the library installed, it will fall back to normal logging.
