<h2>Androzoo Scripts Summary</h2>
<h3>Instruction for get_apk_from_androzoo.py:</h3>
The script is utilized to download APKs from Androzoo using a list of sha256 keys

We need the following inputs to run this script:
api_key_file, hash_file, output_dir

1) Create an API Key file which only contains the API Key and nothing else. Also, add the name of the API Key File to the .gitignore file.
2) The hash file can be taken from the [Datasets](https://github.com/maryam-tanha/StaticAndroidMalwareAnalysis/tree/main/DataCollection/Datasets) folder which has list of sha256 keys categorized by the year.
3) Create an output directory. For example: output/
4) After the above 3 steps are completed, navigate to the AndrozooScripts folder and run the following command.
    ```
    python3 get_apk_from_androzoo.py [-h] api_key_file hash_list_file output_dir
    ```
    For example for benign_apks_2017.txt file (Assuming your current directory is AndroZooScripts folder):
    
        python3 get_apk_from_androzoo.py azApiKeyFile.txt ../Datasets/benign_apks_2017.txt /output
        Num hashes: 5304
        sha256 to download: a7f5522c5775945950aab6531979c78fd407238131fabd94a0cb47343a402f91
        Done
        ...
If you do not have "requests" and "tqdm" nodules install, you need to install them as foolows. For example on Windpws:
   ```
    python3 -m pip install requests
 ```
and
 ```
python3 -m pip install tqdm
```
