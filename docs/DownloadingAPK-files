To download apk files from your phone:
- Option 1: Download [APK Downloader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.barraco.carlo.apkdownloader&hl=en&gl=US)
The nice thing about it is that it asks you to choose a folder for downloading the apk files. It shows all the apps on your mobile phone and you can choose an app to download its apk file.

- Option 2: Download [AirDroid](https://www.airdroid.com/) and install it. If you go to web.airdroid.com on your desktop or mobile phone, it shows the list of all apks on your phone and you can download all or select some to download.
