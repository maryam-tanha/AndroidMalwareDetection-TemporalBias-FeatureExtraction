## NOTE:
The Python code, get\_permissions\_apicalls.py, creates feature vectors for all apps based on their extracted features (only permissions and API calls) and generates a CVS file. Each row of this file contains the feature vector for an app.  a valueThe zero value indicates that the feature is not present for that app and a value of 1 indicates otherwise.

You need to indicate in the code (change line 98) whether you want to create feature vectors for benign apps or malware.

The resources folder includes the list of selected paermissions and API calls as features.

Create a subfolder called outputs under the FeatureVectorCreation.
